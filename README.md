This directory contains an example of my work in science and programming. It contains:

1. Plots pertaining to the Dphi analysis (Either 4 momentum or other specific variable cuts), perhaps I'll add a script or two to demonstrate some techniques such as sideband subtraction or another

2. Plots and scripts from a scientific algorithms class. One from the ising model chapter, one from the bose einstein condensates, and one from the traveling salesman

3. I will also add my Real Estate Calculator program

4. Any programs from CAAM 420?
